  "Powdery": [
    "Apply sulphur-based fungicides or potassium bicarbonate sprays as first-line options.",
    "Use neem oil or horticultural oils for an organic control approach.",
    "Improve air circulation (prune dense canopies) and reduce leaf wetness—avoid overhead irrigation at night.",
    "Remove and safely dispose of heavily infected leaves to reduce inoculum.",
    "If applying chemical fungicides, follow label directions and local extension advice for product choice, timing and dosage."

    "Apply protective copper-based fungicides or multi-site contact fungicides for early/manageable infections.",
    "For severe infections, consider approved systemic fungicides following local guidelines and resistance management practices.",
    "Remove and destroy heavily infected material; do not compost symptomatic tissue.",
    "Reduce leaf wetness by avoiding overhead irrigation and improving spacing/air flow.",
    "Rotate crops and plant resistant varieties where available to reduce long-term rust pressure."

  "default": [
    "Symptoms unclear — retake pictures from multiple leaves/angles and re-test.",
    "Consult your local agricultural extension service for product recommendations and precise dosages.",
    "Use integrated disease management: cultural controls, resistant varieties, and targeted chemical or biological controls when necessary."
